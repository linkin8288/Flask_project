            Akershus Fortress is a great place to discover Oslo's history and enjoy a summer day.

The building of Akershus Castle and Fortress was commenced in 1299 under king HÃ¥kon V. The medieval castle, which was completed in the 1300s, had a strategic location at the very end of the headland, and withstood a number of sieges throughout the ages. King Christian IV (1588-1648) had the castle modernised and converted into a Renaissance castle and royal residence.
